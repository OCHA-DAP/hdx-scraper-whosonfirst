caveats: "Who's On First data is updated on an as needed basis. After a database update, the new data will be available for download within 24-hours. Not all countries include features and/or polygons for the full range of administrative levels and some others may be out-of-date or have poor spatial resolution. Some populated place human settlements may be missing because of older, incomplete, or inaccurate source material and most are represented as a point geometry."
